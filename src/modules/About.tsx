        For the past few years, web development has been my focus. My desire to work is really nice,
        particularly on the newest technologies. My passion for web dev goes back when I was 17
        years old when I was starting to learn HTML and CSS and I was like "This is really
        interesting! :)"

        In my spare time, I'm working on <strong>Sillyfrog</strong>, a social media application and
        poured all of my knowledge into it, and it gained 100 users across the country and I've also
        built another applications which most of the users are fascinated about. I am also designing
        UI designs on Figma!

        In my free time, I usually go hang out with my friends and family. I love travelling with my
        love ones and having a new experience on a different places. I am also planning to trail
        hike on mountain soon. ;)
